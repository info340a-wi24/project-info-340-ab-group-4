# Seattle Curtain Call

This project was created by Juliette Jones, Jason Yu, Salley Fang, and Salley Fang as their final project proposal for INFO 340, Winter 2024.

## Features

Our project features the following features:

### 1. Event Calendar

* Filter events based on genre, audience size, and pricepoint
* Can view multiple months using arrows
* Can click on an event on the calendar and view an external website for it
* Can view new events submitted using the Event Submission page

### 2. Events

* Can search events by name or scroll through list
* After clicking event details, takes users to a card with venue location, venue address, dates & times of events, link to buy tickets by clicing 

### 3. 

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
