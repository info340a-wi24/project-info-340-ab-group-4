        The field of performing arts is rich in diversity and cultural significance. 
        And in this spotlight of mainstream large-scale theatrical productions, many hidden gems are overlooked:
        these smaller performances, which include theater, dance, music, and other forms of performing arts, are often organized by local groups, student organizations, and independent artists.
        Despite their great potential and cultural value, these productions struggle to gain visibility and audience impact.
        This is largely due to the dominance of established systematic performances in the present day.
        The visibility gap reflects a number of problems: many potential audiences are unaware of these great local arts. 
        These smaller shows are underrepresented. This not only affects their viability, but also limits the cultural diversity of communities.

        We're bridging this gap with [INSERT WEB APP NAME HERE]. 
        This applicaiton will address the needs of fringe theaters, student groups, and other small performing arts organizations by providing them with a centralized space to list their events. 
        This approach not only addresses the issue of visibility for smaller productions, but also serves as an educational tool for the community, potentially expanding the audience base for these art forms.
        The site aims to address underrepresentation and the lack of diverse cultural experiences. 
        It seeks to fill specific gaps that have not been addressed by existing platforms, thereby fostering a more inclusive and vibrant local arts scene.

        Our web application, [INSERT WEB APP NAME HERE], is tailored for enthusiasts of fringe productions, which include theater, concert, improv, and other types of performances in the Seattle area.
        [WEB APP NAME] caters to both Seattle locals and visitors, providing a platform to discover, organize, and engage with the diverse performance communities within the city.
        Our primary user base is individuals interested in information on upcoming fringe productions in the Seattle area. We primarily target those who are looking for entertainment options in the local scene,
        introducing them to unique performances they may not have known about otherwise.

        The kind of information users will be viewing is details about fringe productions happening around Seattle including descriptions, time, location, posters, performer descriptions, and links to purchase tickets.
        We will also have sections that describe each type of performance to those unfamiliar with a particular type of production. The information users will be viewing will come from various event websites,
        like (https://www.seattle-theatre.com), (https://soundtheatrecompany.org), and (https://everout.com/seattle/events/?category=live-music-concert).

        The app provides users with the ability to not only view but actively engage with the content. They can filter events based on preferences (e.g., location, type of event, audience size), submit new events
        to contribute to the community, and save shows they are interested in onto a personal calendar to track and plan for upcoming events. Using this app, users will be able to take part in curating
        their own event calendar customized to their interests. By providing a centralized platform tailored for fringe theaters, student groups, and smaller performing arts organizations,
        our app will help bridge the visibility gap these productions face. We address the issue of visibility by offering a dedicated space for smaller performances.
        Our app also can help solve problems of exposure to the arts by serving as an educational tool providing introductions to different types of performances. Because fringe theater performances are likely
        less expensive and easier to get tickets for, those unfamiliar with certain art forms may feel more comfortable buying tickets for and attending these events.
        And lastly, [WEB APP NAME], addresses the issue of a lack of diverse cultural experiences. It helps fill gaps left by bigger performance calendar platforms that prioritize more well-known shows and venues
        by highlighting smaller performances. We hope our app can serve as a catalyst for a more inclusive and diverse fringe production scene in Seattle.
